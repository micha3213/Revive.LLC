<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Effective Date: February 12, 2026</p>

<p>Welcome! By purchasing access, subscription, or authorization (“Authorization”) from [Your Business Name], you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read them carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Grant of Authorization</h2>
<p>Upon successful payment, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the services, content, or digital products you purchased (the “Services”). This Authorization is for personal use only, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
<p>All payments are processed securely through <strong>Stripe, Inc.</strong>. By purchasing an Authorization, you agree to pay the fees stated at the time of checkout. You are responsible for any taxes applicable to your purchase.</p>

<p>If you have a recurring subscription, payments will be automatically charged according to the billing interval selected at checkout. You may cancel recurring subscriptions according to Section 4 below.</p>

<h2>3. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
<p>Because this is a digital Authorization, refunds are generally <strong>not available</strong> unless required by law. You may cancel a recurring subscription at any time via your account or by contacting support, but any payments already processed are non-refundable.</p>

<h2>4. Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resell, redistribute, or share your Authorization with others;</li>
  <li>Use the Services for illegal purposes;</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer, copy, or modify any content, software, or systems provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, services, and software remain the property of [Your Business Name] or its licensors. You are granted only the limited rights described in these Terms.</p>

<h2>6. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to revoke your Authorization for violations of these Terms, prohibited use, or abuse of our services.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, [Your Business Name] is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Services.</p>

<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Country/State]. Any disputes must be resolved in the courts of this jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The current version will always be available at this URL. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
